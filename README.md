Redbeeweather-web

This app was created following the tutorial in 
www.sitepoint.com/crud-app-react-redux-feathersjs/

It still has code copied from that tutorial that is not completely working, mainly the code related to actions and reducers.

Also, the notification from the socket should probably be done from a reducer, but I could not make it work, I receive well, but I can't parse it to a object to update weather conditions.
